# 💡 LeetFriend

LeetFriend is a Chrome extension designed to supercharge your LeetCode problem-solving experience. It displays progressive hints inside a draggable and resizable overlay directly on LeetCode problem pages. With just a click or keyboard shortcut, you can move through hints, from mild nudges to full solutions, without ever leaving the page.

The overlay also shows beautifully formatted code snippets with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and copy buttons.

- Make sure to allow the extension to run on leetcode.com if prompted by Chrome.

## 🐞 Current Cons  

- Right now, this app runs on all leetcode pages, instead of only the leetcode problems. Will fix this soon.
- Code is not using color highlights and line numbering due to some rendering bug with chrome extensions.
